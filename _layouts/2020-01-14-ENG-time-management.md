Here is what Elisabeth Hendrickson said in *The Tyranny of the "To Do" List*[2](http://www.stickyminds.com/sitewide.asp?ObjectId=6656&Function=DETAILBROWSE&ObjectType=COL)

\>I often struggle with the feeling that I must complete everything on my "To Do" list, an impossible task. Worse, I sometimes feel required to finish certain onerous "To Do" list items before I move on to the more interesting tasks on my plate. Some of the onerous tasks may be less strategically important than the fun ones, but they're on my "To Do" list, so I feel they must be done. The end result in some cases is that neither the onerous nor the fun tasks get done. I'm stuck.

The most popular prejudice is everything you should do is a task. Then, if you want to get the most of the benefit, you should complete as many tasks as possible, but people are not task machine or cpu. Free minds and artistic lives are not adaptive for the **'task machine' metaphor**. The real happy thing is not how much you completed, but how much you do what you really want to do.

There're several important words from academics to help us understand time management. First is self-control. I'd like to say time managment itself is a kind of self-control, it is about controling your time, so that's easy to understand why you need self-control skills to help you eliminate useless time and do the right thing at the right time. 



Let's talk about the first, maybe you have heard Lyubishchevâ€˜s way that he keep record how he spend time on everything, it's hard and boring for many people(and me!). Linda Hill and Kent Lineback found a new way to deal with it. That's what they call "prep-do-review"[6](https://hbr.org/2011/03/better-time-management-is-not), I don't want to explain it since I've given you the page. My compliment is, it's a great model to help you reorganize yourself if you step into daily chaos.



The Second word is habit.[This](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/mind-guest-blog/should-habits-or-goals-direct-your-life-it-depends/) article from *Scientific American*[7] well explained the difference between goal-directed and habitual processes
